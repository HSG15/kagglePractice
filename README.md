# Spark & HDFS Basics

You're not alone‚Äîmany beginners feel confused when trying to connect all the components like **HDFS**, **RDD**, **DAG**, and **Spark** together. Let's break this down in a very **simple, beginner-friendly, and step-by-step** manner.

| **HDFS**  | A storage system to store **huge files** across many computers.                         |
| **Spark** | A processing engine that performs **fast, distributed data processing**.                |
| **RDD**   | A low-level **data structure in Spark** used to work with data in a distributed manner. |
| **DAG**   | A **graph** showing how operations are connected and the **execution plan** in Spark.   |

## üéØ REAL-WORLD FLOW FOR DATA ENGINEERS

### Step 1: üîç Data Source (HDFS)

* You have a **huge dataset** (log files, CSVs, Parquet, etc.) stored in **HDFS**
* Example: `/user/data/transactions.csv`

### Step 2: ‚öôÔ∏è Spark Reads from HDFS

* You launch a **Spark job** to process this data
* You use **RDDs** or **DataFrames** to **load** the data from HDFS

```python
